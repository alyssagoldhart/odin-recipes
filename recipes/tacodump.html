                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Combine salsa, green chiles, chili powder, cumin, and salt in a large bowl. Stir in chicken, black beans, and corn.</li>
